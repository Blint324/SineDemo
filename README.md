# SineDemo
A simple sine wave demo meant for my school. This took about 40 minutes or so.

# Troubleshooting
If the program encounters an error, simply type "pip install pysinewave" into the terminal. Simple as that!

# About
This is just a sine wave creator program I made. Written ENTIRELY (no help from anyone or anything else) by Vámosi Bálint.
Absolutely NO generative A.I (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Bard etc.) was used. I take a very strict anti-A.I stance in my code.
This was written on, and meant to be run on Linux. Windows support is untested. Just use WSL if you use Windows.
Keep in mind, this was written with me having literally no knowlege of making sine waves in python. Excuse me if some of the code is a bit messy, I'll maybe clean it up later.
This is FREE and OPEN SOURCE software! You can distribute this, fork this, whatever. In my past projects, I used the M.I.T license, which is also open source, but it doesn't allow all types of distribution.
With this however, you can modify it, make it closed source (on your copy, obviously) do whatever you want!
